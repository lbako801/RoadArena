 # Developers
Hey there, I'm Loren Bako, the creator behind this amazing app! As a passionate motorcycle enthusiast, I wanted to create an app that would help riders like me find new adventures and connect with other riders. And since I couldn't find anything that fit the bill, I decided to take matters into my own hands!
